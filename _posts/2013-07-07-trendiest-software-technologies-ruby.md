Sometimes code monkeys like us can get so involved in their own systems that they lose all sight of anything or anybody else outside of their niche. But it can be interesting to see what guys in other camps are doing (and how big they're getting). Enter Google's list of Trendiest Software Technologies.

<h3><a href="http://www.pinupgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/Trendiest-Software-Technologies.png"><img class="pull-right img-responsive" alt="Trendiest Software Technologies" src="http://www.pinupgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/Trendiest-Software-Technologies-212x300.png" width="212" height="300" /></a>Google Trends</h3>
Google (an online search engine -- perhaps you've heard of it) doesn't just serve search results. It also analyzes search data to identify patterns and trends. It seems that the primary goal of this analysis is to allow Google to provide better (i.e. <a title="Search Engine Optimization - Avid Netizen" href="http://www.avidnetizen.com/search-engine-optimization/" target="_blank">more relevant) search results</a>, but they also use it to create interesting public-facing products like "<a title="Google Trends" href="http://www.google.com/trends/" target="_blank">Google Trends</a>."

In addition to providing just the top 10 trendiest searches overall, Google also breaks this information down into categories. This allows you to see, for example, the top 20 sports, reality shows, athletes, or DJs (<a title="Skrillex" href="http://skrillex.com/" target="_blank">Skrillex</a>, we love you).

And of course, Google also lists the trendiest software technologies.
<h3>Trendiest Software Technologies</h3>
Of the top five most popular technologies, four of them (<a title="SQL" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" target="_blank">SQL</a>, <a title="HTML" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html" target="_blank">HTML</a>, <a title="Java" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java</a>, and <a title="Javascript" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>) have been in the top ten for over 114 months (probably the time that Google started this program). The #5 spot CSS has only been in the top 10 for 101 months.

In this list of 20, <a title="Ruby" href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/" target="_blank">Ruby</a> comes in at #15, beating out <a title="ASP.NET" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asp.net" target="_blank">ASP.NET</a>, <a title="HTML5" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5" target="_blank">HTML5</a>, <a title="R" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)" target="_blank">R</a>, <a title="Perl" href="http://www.perl.org/" target="_blank">Perl</a>, and <a title="LaTex" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX" target="_blank">LaTex</a>, respectively.

<strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> doesn't make the list at all.
