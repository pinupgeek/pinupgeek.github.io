Summer is upon us and it's time for some of us to take a vacation. For me that means a brief trip to <a title="Louisville, Kentucky" href="http://www.louisvilleky.gov/" target="_blank">Louisville, Kentucky</a>.

I've been to Louisville several times, but there are a few new spots that I'd like to visit this trip. For those of you who've never been, here are some things to check out if you ever get the chance.
<h3>Tourist Attractions in Louisville</h3>
Louisville isn't a huge city (it's <a title="List of United States cities by population" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population" target="_blank">27th in the country by population</a>), but at over half a million people, it isn't too small either. And in a city of this size, there are plenty of attractions to see.
<h4>Downtown Louisville</h4>
In addition to being a bustling business district, downtown Louisville is very welcoming to tourists. These are just some of the museums in the area:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Frazier History Museum</span></li>
	<li>Glassworks</li>
	<li>Louisville Slugger Museum &amp; Factory (they'll give you a free miniature baseball bat if you take a tour)</li>
	<li>Kentucky Science Center</li>
	<li>Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft</li>
	<li>21c Museum and Hotel</li>
	<li>The Muhammad Ali Center</li>
	<li>The Kentucky Center for the Performing Arts</li>
</ul>
And if you're a coffee drinker (like <a title="Pin-Up Geek" href="http://www.pinupgeek.com">any respectable geek</a> is), be sure to check out <a title="Concept Espresso Bar Invades Downtown Louisville" href="http://www.thecoffeecompass.com/concept-espresso-bar-louisville-sunergos/" target="_blank">the new Sunergos Espresso bar on 5th Street</a> while you're downtown.
<h4>Churchill Downs</h4>
When most people think of Louisville, the Kentucky Derby comes to mind. Of course it's held in the beautiful <a title="Churchill Downs" href="http://www.churchilldowns.com/" target="_blank">Churchill Downs</a>. Unfortunately I'm going to be a few months late for the Derby, but there are other horse races held there as well.
<h3>Louisville Restaurants</h3>
In addition to the other tourist attractions, Louisville hosts a ton of delicious restaurants. In fact, it was <a title="America's Foodiest Small Town Runners-Up" href="http://www.bonappetit.com/blogsandforums/blogs/bafoodist/2009/09/americas-foodiest-small-town-r.html" target="_blank">recently named</a> one of the "foodiest cities" in America.

I've been to a lot of Louisville's restaurants on previous trips, but this time I'm looking forward to trying out <a title="Four Pegs Beer Lounge" href="http://fourpegsbeerlounge.com" target="_blank">a new pub/beer bar -- Four Pegs Beer Lounge</a>. Supposedly they have a delicious chicken waffle sandwich that I'm dying to try.
<h3>Future Geekiness</h3>
I'll be gone for a few days, but when I return expect some more posts about <a title="Getting Started with Rails" href="http://www.pinupgeek.com/getting-started-with-rails/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> and some other recent projects.
