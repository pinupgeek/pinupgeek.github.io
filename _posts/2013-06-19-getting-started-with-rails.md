In much of my previous work, I’ve talked about [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/ "Rails"), but it occurs to me that perhaps some of you may not be very familiar with Rails or how to get started.

Good news for you: it’s very easy to get into.

###What is Ruby on Rails?
Called “Rails” for short, it is a framework for building web applications. It’s based on the programming language Ruby, but you don’t have to learn Ruby first. Lots of folks just jump straight into Rails.

It’s open source, so it’s free to acquire, free to use, and free to modify. The source code is “open,” so if you care to know you can peek under the hood to see what’s going on.

Like a lot of other web coding tools, Rails uses the Model-View-Controller ([MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-View-Controller "MVC")) approach to development. In short, the model is your data, the view is how it is presented, and the controller is what brings the two together into an attractive front-end.

###What Can You Do with Rails?
Pretty much any web app could be built with Rails: anything from a blogging CMS to a social network to an ecommerce site.

###How to Get Started with Ruby on Rails
Getting started with Ruby on Rails is relatively simple. If you don’t already have the development software installed on your computer, the fastest, easiest way to get it is with the [RailsInstaller](http://railsinstaller.org/ "RailsInstaller").

Once you have the tools you need, the next step is to learn how to use them. The official Rails website has tons of [guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/ "guides") and tutorials to show you the ropes. There are also paid courses on sites like [Treehouse](http://referrals.trhou.se/stephenlee "Treehouse").

In summary, it’s relatively quick and easy to get started with Ruby on Rails, even if you’re starting from scratch.
